# Auto-Exam
Automatic multiple-choice examination system built with a Python server 
project is a lightweight multiple-choice examination system built with a Python server using only standard libraries (http.server, OS, random, datetime, urllib). It reads a text file with exam questions and answers(the correct answer on top), randomizes them, checks answers, and provides feedback and grades to students. The system also summarizes all students' grades on the server side. The entire project is self-contained, with no additional dependencies, and very lightweight at about 100 kilobytes. It runs on Windows 10 and is compatible with Python versions 3.10 and 3.13.
