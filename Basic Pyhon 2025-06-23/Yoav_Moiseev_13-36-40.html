What is a project you would like to build using Python, and what tools/libraries would you need for it?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  >####################################################
## 1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators
####################################################

# You have numbers
3  # => 3

# Math is what you would expect
1 + 1   # => 2
8 - 1   # => 7
10 * 2  # => 20
35 / 5  # => 7.0

# Integer division rounds down for both positive and negative numbers.
5 // 3       # => 1
-5 // 3      # => -2
5.0 // 3.0   # => 1.0 # works on floats too
-5.0 // 3.0  # => -2.0</pre></li><li><b>2. In your opinion, what are the most efficient fields in which Python can be used (e.g., Data Science, Web, Artificial Intelligence)?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  ># The result of division is always a float
10.0 / 3  # => 3.3333333333333335

# Modulo operation
7 % 3   # => 1
# i % j have the same sign as j, unlike C
-7 % 3  # => 2

# Exponentiation (x**y, x to the yth power)
2**3  # => 8

# Enforce precedence with parentheses
1 + 3 * 2    # => 7
(1 + 3) * 2  # => 8

# Boolean values are primitives (Note: the capitalization)
True   # => True
False  # => False

# negate with not
not True   # => False
not False  # => True</pre></li><li><b>3. What is the output of the following Python code  `print(2 + 3 *  4)`?</b>                <pre  >14</pre></li><li><b>4. How can proper use of functions improve the structure and quality of Python code?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  ># Boolean Operators
# Note "and" and "or" are case-sensitive
True and False  # => False
False or True   # => True

# True and False are actually 1 and 0 but with different keywords
True + True # => 2
True * 8    # => 8
False - 5   # => -5

# Comparison operators look at the numerical value of True and False
0 == False  # => True
2 > True    # => True
2 == True   # => False
-5 != False # => True</pre></li><li><b>5. Explain in simple words the difference between `=` and `==` in Python.</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  ># None, 0, and empty strings/lists/dicts/tuples/sets all evaluate to False.
# All other values are True
bool(0)     # => False
bool("")    # => False
bool([])    # => False
bool({})    # => False
bool(())    # => False
bool(set()) # => False
bool(4)     # => True
bool(-6)    # => True

# Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation,
# but their non-cast value is returned. Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise
# and/or (&,|)
bool(0)     # => False
bool(2)     # => True
0 and 2     # => 0
bool(-5)    # => True
bool(2)     # => True
-5 or 0     # => -5
