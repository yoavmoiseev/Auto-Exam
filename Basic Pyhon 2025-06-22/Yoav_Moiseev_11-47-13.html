Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and prints: "Hello [name]!"?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  >####################################################
## 2. Variables and Collections
####################################################

# Python has a print function
print("I'm Python. Nice to meet you!")  # => I'm Python. Nice to meet you!

# By default the print function also prints out a newline at the end.
# Use the optional argument end to change the end string.
print("Hello, World", end="!")  # => Hello, World!

# Simple way to get input data from console
input_string_var = input("Enter some data: ") # Returns the data as a string

# There are no declarations, only assignments.
# Convention is to use lower_case_with_underscores
some_var = 5
some_var  # => 5
</pre></li><li><b>2. In your opinion, what are the main advantages of the Python programming language compared to other programming languages?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  ># Accessing a previously unassigned variable is an exception.
# See Control Flow to learn more about exception handling.
some_unknown_var  # Raises a NameError

# if can be used as an expression
# Equivalent of C's '?:' ternary operator
"yay!" if 0 > 1 else "nay!"  # => "nay!"
</pre></li><li><b>3. How can proper use of functions improve the structure and quality of Python code?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  ># Lists store sequences
li = []
# You can start with a prefilled list
other_li = [4, 5, 6]

# Add stuff to the end of a list with append
li.append(1)    # li is now [1]
li.append(2)    # li is now [1, 2]
li.append(4)    # li is now [1, 2, 4]
li.append(3)    # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3]
# Remove from the end with pop
li.pop()        # => 3 and li is now [1, 2, 4]
# קצת הערות בשפתנו
li.append(3)    # li is now [1, 2, 4, 3] again.
</pre></li><li><b>4. In your opinion, what are the most efficient fields in which Python can be used (e.g., Data Science, Web, Artificial Intelligence)?</b>                <pre align = 'left' dir ='ltr'  ># You can look at ranges with slice syntax.
# The start index is included, the end index is not
# (It's a closed/open range for you mathy types.)
li[1:3]   # Return list from index 1 to 3 => [2, 4]
li[2:]    # Return list starting from index 2 => [4, 3]
li[:3]    # Return list from beginning until index 3  => [1, 2, 4]
li[::2]   # Return list selecting every second entry => [1, 4]
li[::-1]  # Return list in reverse order => [3, 4, 2, 1]
# Use any combination of these to make advanced slices
# li[start:end:step]
